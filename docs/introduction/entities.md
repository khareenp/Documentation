title: MODV entities terminology
---

MODV at its core is a hierarchical data structure, where entities are stored in a tree-like structure.

There are 3 main types of content entities:
- Vaults
- Folders
- Documents

Furthermore for managing bulk user accounts we offer the [Admin Control Panel](https://admin.modv.io) which is a web application that allows you to manage your organisations users, groups, to quickly gain an insight into who are the active users and if you have any stale documents that are not being accessed.

:::note Enterprise
We have a wide range of standard reports that can be accessed though the API's, but for more advanced reports please contact us.

## Vaults
This is a root level entity that contains all the folders and documents.


## Folders
Folders are the main way to organize your documents.

## Documents
Documents are the actual files that you want to store.
